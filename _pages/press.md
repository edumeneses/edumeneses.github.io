Long Form Biography (The "Full Story")

Edu Meneses is an art technologist and composer whose work sits at the intersection of sound, technology, and performance. As a digital luthier, he specializes in the design and creation of new interfaces for musical expression, blending the tactile nature of performance with advanced digital processing.

Currently the Research Director at the Société des Arts Technologiques (SAT), Edu leads initiatives in immersion and digital arts. He holds a Ph.D. in Music Technology from McGill University, where he conducted extensive work with the Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL) and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT).

Edu’s practice is defined by research-creation, a methodology that fuses academic inquiry with artistic output. His work focuses on embedded systems for digital arts, sound spatialization, and gestural control for performances and installations.

Through his works and projects, Edu investigates complex topics like latency in digital communication, Digital Signal Processing (DSP), and mapping strategies for immersive environments. Whether designing a new instrument or performing live, his goal remains constant: to expand the boundaries of how we create and experience sound.

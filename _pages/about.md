Hello, I'm **Edu Meneses**. I am a researcher and strategic leader in the digital arts ecosystem, dedicated to shaping the future of creative technology.

As the **Research Director** at the Société des Arts Technologiques (SAT), I drive the strategic roadmap for innovations in immersion, interaction, and co-creation. My work focuses on uniting fundamental research, art-science, and R&D to empower the arts.

I hold a Ph.D. in Music Technology from McGill University (IDMIL and CIRMMT), where I specialized in creating technological solutions, including **IoT**, **gestural control**, **embedded systems**, and **sound spatialization**. I am committed to the open-source philosophy and share my work to empower the worldwide creator community.

Active in the Quebec ecosystem, I combine my engineering background with my practice as a research-creator to build tools that are robust enough for the stage and expressive enough for art exploration.

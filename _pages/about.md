Edu Meneses is a strategic leader in the digital arts ecosystem, dedicated to shaping the future of creative technology.

As a **Research Director** at the **Société des Arts Technologiques (SAT)**, he bridges the gap between fundamental research, art-science and R&D for the arts. Currently leading research at SAT, Edu drives the strategic roadmap for innovations in immersion, interaction, and co-creation.

With a Ph.D. in Music Technology from **McGill University** (IDMIL and CIRMMT), his expertise lies in creating technological solutions for the arts. He has been a central figure in the Quebec art-tech community, developing open-source platforms that empower creators, including:

* **Digital Luthiery:** Designing novel interfaces like the **GuitarAMI** and **T-Stick**, and the **Probatio** prototyping toolkit.
* **Infrastructure Strategy:** Creating the **Puara** framework to solve critical latency and communication challenges in digital ecosystems.
* **Public Innovation:** Leading complex implementations for public spaces, such as **Le Vivier Mobile**.

Edu combines technical rigor with a composer’s sensitivity, focusing on how embedded systems and sound spatialization can scale from the lab to the stage.

Active in the Quebec art-tech ecosystem, Edu combines his background in engineering with his practice as a performer to build tools that are robust enough for the stage and expressive enough for art exploration.
